Process:

I started by creating empty react and react native projects in two separate folders, for web and mobile.

I decided to start working on mobile. I created empty mobile pages with basic components. They contained no data (except some placeholder text) and no style, it was just a framework of React Native (and custom) components.

I added some basic navigation functions, to allow movement between pages by pressing on the basic text components.


After creating the framework pages for mobile, I started work on the web portion. I followed the same process, starting with adding empty pages and creating the basic components. I enabled navigation to each of the pages.
