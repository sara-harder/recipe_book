Process:

I started by creating empty react and react native projects in two separate folders, for web and mobile.

I decided to start working on mobile. I created empty mobile pages with basic components. They contained no data (except some placeholder text) and no style, it was just a framework of React Native (and custom) components.

I added some basic navigation functions, to allow movement between pages by pressing on the basic text components.


After creating the framework pages for mobile, I started work on the web portion. I followed the same process, starting with adding empty pages and creating the basic components. A lot of the components could be copied from mobile, then changed to follow HTML instead of React Native. I enabled navigation to each of the pages as well.






Stretch Goals:
Have the ingredients follow along with the directions. When the user clicks a direction, the ingredients jump next to it, and highlight the ingredients needed for the direction
Change the ingredient units from metric to imperial and back
Change the number of portions
Checkbox to filter items by seasonal vegetables only 
Add recipes into multiple categories, so you can find it anywhere you think of (including vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free)
